    <p>Returns must be in their original, unused, and undamaged condition with all tags attached and all packaging included. Return time frames are either 14 days or final sale; this is indicated in each item's description located on the product page. Pieces sent back after the return period or without original packaging and the security tag attached, will not be refunded. Our system prevents prepaid shipping labels and return authorization forms from being created past the returns window. Be advised that all returns have a 7 day shipping window from the day the RMA is assigned. Shipping charges are not refundable. *Important Note: Late returns will not be accepted past their indicated returns period and no refund will be issued.</p>
